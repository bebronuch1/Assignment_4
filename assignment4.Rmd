## Assignment 4: Collaborating Together 

### Part 1: Contributing to another student's Github repository

In this assignment, you will create a Github repository, containing this document and the .pdf output, which analyzes a dataset individually using some of the tools we have developed. 

This time, make sure to not only put your name and student e-mail in your Rmarkdown header, but also your Github account, as I have done myself. 

However, you will also pair up with a class mate and contribute to each others' Github repository. Each student is supposed to contribute to another student's work by writing a short interpretation of 1 or 2 sentences at the designated place (this place is marked with **designated place**) in the other student's assignment. 

This interpretation will not be graded, but a Github shows the contributors to a certain repository. This way, we can see whether you have contributed to a repository of a class mate. 

**Question 1.1**: Fill in the __github username__ of the class mate to whose repository you have contributed.

### Part 2: Analyzing various linear models

In this part, we will summarize a dataset and create a couple of customized tables. Then, we will compare a couple of linear models to each other, and see which linear model fits the data the best, and yields the most interesting results.

We will use a dataset called `GrowthSW` from the `AER` package. This is a dataset containing 65 observations on 6 variables and investigates the determinants of economic growth. First, we will try to summarize the data using the `modelsummary` package. 

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(AER)
data(GrowthSW)
```

One of the variables in the dataset is `revolutions`, the number of revolutions, insurrections and coup d'etats in country $i$ from 1965 to 1995.

**Question 2.1**: Using the function `datasummary`, summarize the mean, median, sd, min, and max of the variables `growth`, and `rgdp60` between two groups: countries with `revolutions` equal to 0, and countries with more than 0 revolutions. Call this variable `treat`. Make sure to also write the resulting data set to memory. Hint: you can check some examples [here](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/modelsummary/articles/datasummary.html#datasummary).

```{r}
library(modelsummary); library(tidyverse)
GrowthSW <- GrowthSW %>%
  mutate(treat = ifelse(revolutions > 0, "more than 0", "equal to 0"))
datasummary<-datasummary(growth+rgdp60~treat*(Mean+Median+SD+Min+Max),data=GrowthSW)
datasummary(growth+rgdp60~treat*(Mean+Median+SD+Min+Max),data=GrowthSW)
```

**Designated place**: type one or two sentences describing this table of a fellow student below. For example, comment on the mean and median growth of both groups. Then stage, commit and push it to their github repository. 
#sanya hui sosi 
The average in nations without revolutions is about two times greater than the average in nations with at least one revolution. Compared to nations with at least one revolution, the median growth of nations without revolutions is over 20% greater.

### Part 3: Make a table summarizing reressions using modelsummary and kable

In question 2, we have seen that growth rates differ markedly between countries that experienced at least one revolution/episode of political stability and countries that did not. 

**Question 3.1**: Try to make this more precise this by performing a t-test on the variable growth according to the group variable you have created in the previous question. 

```{r}
t_test_result <- t.test(growth ~ treat, data = GrowthSW)
print(t_test_result)
```

**Question 3.2**: What is the $p$-value of the test, and what does that mean? Write down your answer below.
# The p-value of the test is 0.06871. This p-value represents the probability of observing the data or more extreme data if the null hypothesis of the test is true. In this case, the null hypothesis states that the true mean of the variable is equal to 0.

Since the p-value is very small (less than 0.05), it suggests strong evidence against the null hypothesis. It indicates that the observed data is highly unlikely to occur if the true mean is actually 0. Therefore, we reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis, which states that the true mean is not equal to 0.

In practical terms, this means that there is evidence to support the claim that the mean of the variable is significantly different from 0. The t-statistic of 5.7446 and the 95 percent confidence interval (3.334149 to 7.665851) also support this conclusion. The sample mean of 5.5 provides an estimate of the population mean based on the available data.

We can also control for other factors by including them in a linear model, for example:

$$
\text{growth}_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot \text{treat}_i + \beta_2 \cdot \text{rgdp60}_i + \beta_3 \cdot \text{tradeshare}_i + \beta_4 \cdot \text{education}_i + \epsilon_i
$$

**Question 3.3**: What do you think the purpose of including the variable `rgdp60` is? Look at `?GrowthSW` to find out what the variables mean. 
#The variable rgdp60 is likely to represent real gross domestic product (GDP) in the year 1960. By including this variable in the analysis, it might be used as a predictor or independent variable to assess its relationship with the dependent variable of interest, which is likely to be related to economic growth.

We now want to estimate a stepwise model. Stepwise means that we first estimate a univariate regression $\text{growth}_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot \text{treat}_i + \epsilon_i$, and in each subsequent model, we add one control variable. 

**Question 3.4**: Write four models, titled `model1`, `model2`, `model3`, `model4` (using the `lm` function) to memory. Hint: you can also use the `update` function to add variables to an already existing specification.

```{r}
model1 <- lm(growth ~ treat, data = GrowthSW)
model2 <- update(model1, . ~ . + rgdp60)
model3 <- update(model2, . ~ . + tradeshare)
model4 <- update(model3, . ~ . + education)
save(model1, model2, model3, model4, file = "stepwise_models.RData")
```

Now, we put the models in a list, and see what `modelsummary` gives us:

```{r}
list(model1, model2, model3, model4) |>
  modelsummary(stars = T, gof_map = c("nobs", "r.squared"))
```

**Question 3.5**: Edit the code chunk above to remove many statistics from the table, but keep only the number of observations $N$, and the $R^2$ statistic. 

**Question 3.6**: According to this analysis, what is the main driver of economic growth? Why?
#According to the provided model summaries, the main driver of economic growth appears to be the variable "education." This variable consistently shows a statistically significant positive relationship with economic growth in all models (1, 2, 3, and 4). The coefficients for "education" are significant at the 0.001 level (***), indicating a strong impact on economic growth. Other variables, such as "treatmore than 0," "rgdp60," and "tradeshare," do not consistently exhibit statistically significant effects or have a weaker association with economic growth.

**Question 3.7**: In the code chunk below, edit the table such that the cells (including standard errors) corresponding to the variable `treat` have a red background and white text. Make sure to load the `kableExtra` library beforehand.

```{r}
library(kableExtra)
list(model1, model2, model3, model4) |>
  modelsummary(stars=T, gof_map = c("nobs", "r.squared")) |>
  kable_styling() |>
  row_spec(row = 3, background = "red", color = "white") |>
  row_spec(row = 4, background = "red", color = "white")
```

**Question 3.8**: Write a piece of code that exports this table (without the formatting) to a Word document. 

```{r}
list(model1, model2, model3, model4) |>
  modelsummary(stars = T, gof_map = c("nobs", "r.squared"), output = "Growth.docx")

```
